Overall I think this code is ok. All of the memory allocation and host/device
memory copying seems correct, so assuming the add and addHost functions are sensible
the bulk of the code is good. One issue is the default arguments for blocks and threads. Since
64 % 3 != 0, at best this is a suboptimal choice and at worst, depending on what the user enters,
it could cause a crash. Assuming the script is only executed once, if functions other than
add are required the script would need to be edited and recompiled.
