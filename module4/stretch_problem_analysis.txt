The main issue with this code is that the timing events are
wrapped around the encrypt kernel, rather than around either
the host->device or device->host Memcpy operations. 
You can't test the performance delta between pinned and pageable memory
without timing the actual memory transfers.

Another issue with the code is the encrypt kernel function
itself. 
    First, the global MAX/MIN PRINTABLE variables are
swapped, so NUM_ALPHA will end up being negative. The encryption
still works, but it's a confusing naming convention. It's 
also not clear why the offset value (key) is an array. If key only
has one unique element, as a Caesar cipher should,
then the array is wasteful. If key's elements vary with index,
then it's not a Caesar cipher. NUM_ALPHA also should be MAX - MIN + 1.
A corrected encrypt function can be found in my cipher.cu file.
